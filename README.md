# Shaka Player History

This is the source of the Shaka Player History live stream.  It is a
dynamically-generated video stream with a visualization of [Shaka Player][]'s
commit history.  The stream loops forever, and the contents of each iteration
of the loop get longer as more commits are added to Shaka Player.

The video frames are generated by an open-source tool called [Gource][].

The audio of the stream is a loop of 24 solo piano works by J.S. Bach.  See
[sources/bach/#readme](sources/bach/) for details.

The full stream is encoded with [FFmpeg][] and packaged into DASH and HLS by
[Shaka Packager][].  These two tools are orchestrated by [Shaka Streamer][],
which also uploads the output to [Google Cloud Storage][].

The live streams are publicly accessible:
 - DASH: https://storage.googleapis.com/shaka-live-assets/player-source.mpd
 - HLS: https://storage.googleapis.com/shaka-live-assets/player-source.m3u8

## Nota Bene

This is published in the hopes that it is at least interesting, if not useful
to people outside of the Shaka family.  It's also nice for us to have the
details of this stream formalized and revision-controlled.  That said, if you
want to fork it or run your own instances, please go ahead!

Note that before you install or run this, we have hard-coded certain details
that you might want to adjust if you fork this to upload to another location or
to visualize another repository:

 - `scripts/update-git.sh` and `sources/pre-release.log` hard-code the repo URL https://github.com/shaka-project/shaka-player and certain pre-historical details about Shaka Player
 - `scripts/rename-aliases.sh` and `sources/user-images` are specific to Shaka Player committers
 - `sources/title.txt` mentions Shaka Player
 - `launch-streamer.sh` hard-codes the output bucket gs://shaka-live-assets/
